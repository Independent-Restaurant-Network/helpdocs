# Order Guides

Order guides are an essential tool for restaurants to stay organized and efficient. Whether your list includes 5 items
or 500, IRN’s order guides make it easy to track and manage the products you consistently order. Plus, they’re
flexible—so you can adapt them to fit your needs.

## What Are Order Guides?

Order guides help restaurants stay on top of their stock. It’s a curated list of products that you want to keep on hand.
Whether you need fresh produce, pantry staples, or specialty items, your order guide is your go-to tool to make sure
you’re never caught without what you need.

### Two Modes for Order Guides

IRN order guides offer two modes for ultimate flexibility:

- **Quantity Mode**: Keep it simple! Enter exactly how much of each product you want to order. Example: “I need 10 cases
  of tomatoes.”
- **Par Mode**: Perfect for inventory management! Set your target stock level (the "par") for each product, then input
  how much you currently have on hand. IRN will calculate how much to order to bring you back to your desired level.
  Example: “I want 20 cases on hand. I have 5 left. Let’s order 15!”

You can switch between these modes anytime, on a per-guide basis. IRN is all about flexibility that works for you.

### Track Your Total Costs

IRN order guides also show:

- **Total items**: The number of products you’ve added to the guide.
- **Estimated total cost**: A quick snapshot of your budget!

<warning id="estimated-pricing">
    Keep in mind this cost is estimated and may vary for products priced per pound (like meats or produce). 
    IRN attempts to assume a 5% over average cost for these types of product to keep things simple. 
    You will be credited any difference when the product is shipped and an exact price is known.
