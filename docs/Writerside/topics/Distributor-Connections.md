# Distributor Connections

What is a Distributor Connection, and How Does it Work?

A distributor connection is a convenient feature that allows IRN to securely log in to your distributor’s web portal on
your behalf. By doing so, we can automatically download your order guides, pricing, and other order-related
information—saving you time and effort! This process runs on a set schedule (usually once per day), so your data is
always up to date and ready when you need it.

## How the Distributor Connection Works

### Automated Logins

Our system securely logs in to your distributor’s web portal using the credentials you provide. Once logged in, it
retrieves the necessary information, such as:

- Order guides
- Pricing details
- Other order-related data

This information is then used to enhance your experience on our platform by streamlining order management and ensuring
accurate details.

### Encryption and Security

Your username and password are encrypted at all times. Even after you provide your credentials, they remain hidden—even
from us at IRN. We only use them when it’s time to log in to the distributor’s portal, and only for the purpose of
retrieving the order-related data you need.

Rest assured, your login details are never shared with third parties or exposed to unauthorized access.

### Privacy Assurance

We value your trust and privacy. During this process, we do not collect any personal information (like billing details
or private correspondence). Our sole focus is retrieving the order-related data that helps streamline your experience.

## What if My Distributor Uses Two-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA)?

If your distributor’s portal requires additional verification, like a 2FA or MFA code, we’ve got you covered! Here’s how
it works:

### MFA Detection

When our system tries to log in and detects an MFA requirement, we’ll send you a notification via SMS or email.

### Time-Sensitive Code Entry

In the notification, you’ll find a secure link to the IRN website where you can quickly input the required code. Once
entered, our system will complete the login process and retrieve your order-related information.

### Opting in for SMS Notifications

If you’d like to receive MFA requests via SMS, you’ll need to opt in and agree to the terms outlined below. This ensures
we can notify you promptly when your input is needed.

## FAQ

### Is my password safe with IRN?

Absolutely! Your password is fully encrypted using industry-standard encryption techniques. It is only used for logging
in to your distributor’s portal and is never visible to IRN or any third parties.

### What kind of data does IRN retrieve from my distributor?

IRN only collects order-related data, such as order guides and pricing information. Personal, billing, or unrelated data
is not accessed or stored.

<tip>
You may also opt in to allow IRN to collect order status and totals from supported distributors. Doing so will allow
IRN to automatically apply credits to your account for products priced by weight in most cases.

</tip>

#### Opt in for shipping data

If you so choose, you may opt in to have IRN automatically collect additional shipment information on supported
platforms. We will collect your final order amounts

### What happens if I miss an MFA code request?

If you don’t provide the MFA code, the login attempt will fail, and we won’t be able to retrieve your data for that
session. Don’t worry—our system will try again during the next scheduled login window.

### Can I update or revoke my credentials?

Of course! You can update or remove your distributor credentials at any time through your account settings in the IRN
platform.
